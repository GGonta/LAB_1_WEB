It might be the remake of a remake of a remake, but Lady Gaga is flawless in this modern adaptation of A Star Is Born. She plays Ally, a singer-songwriter whose talent impresses famous musician Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) when he encounters her at a small bar. She goes on tour with him, they fall in love, and as her success soars, their relationship is tested time and again by his struggle with drug and alcohol addiction.
