Emotionally fragile Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) arrives at her sister Stella's apartment in New Orleans to start a new life. But she is soon tormented by her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley (played by Marlon Brando), and cracks in her perception of reality begin to form. The legendary film is based on the equally iconic play by Tennessee Williams.
